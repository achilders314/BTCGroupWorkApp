### Description
(As of 9/1/22 this app has 491 copies made!) In this Google Sheets application, I created a comprehensive solution for a problem I had my last year teaching tracking groupwork. I used a framework in class that had up to 10 groups of students simultaneously working at their own whiteboards, and it was a lot to keep track of. So I gathered info from others using the lesson framework and set out to solve the problem!
